## Background and overview
Explorator is a 2D visual game where players will have to find the shortest and efficient path from node A to node B. Players will be able to use their arrow keys to move up , down, side to side in order to arrive at node B. Once they have created their path, Dijkstra's algorithm will run in the background in order to find the shortest path between node a to node b. There will be a score betweeen 0-100 to determine how close the player was to creating the shortest path possible to node B.

## Functionality & MVP
Explorator players are able to: 
* Use their arrow keys to create a path 
* Visualize how Dijkstra's algorithm is able to find the shortest path
* Compare between their own path against Dijkstra's path
* Find out their result which is the outcome of how similar the player's path is against Dijkstra's

## Architecture and technologies
* JavaScript (specifically the Intersection Observer API) for scrolling logic, interactivity, and animations
* Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path
* Webpack for bundling JS files

## Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Research Dijkstra's Algorithm and how to implement it in my project
Day 2: Focus on the the design how it will look like
Day 3: Write the logic, how to use the arrow keys to create a path and the borders
